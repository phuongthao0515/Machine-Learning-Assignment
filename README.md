# Transformer Architecture: Analysis and Application to Machine Translation

## Overview

This work focuses on analyzing and understanding the components and architecture of the Transformer model. It specifically examines the Transformer through the lens of **machine translation** and compares its performance and characteristics with other models and approaches that have been used to solve the same problem.

## Key Concepts

- **Transformer Architecture**: A deep dive into the structure, components, and mechanisms that make the Transformer model highly effective.
- **Machine Translation Application**: How the Transformer has revolutionized machine translation tasks and its advantages over traditional methods.
- **Comparison with Other Models**: An exploration of the performance and principles of various other models and approaches for machine translation, including but not limited to RNNs, LSTMs, and attention-based models.

## Features

- In-depth analysis of each component in the Transformer architecture (Attention Mechanism, Feed-Forward Networks, Positional Encodings, etc.).
- Application of the Transformer in solving machine translation tasks.
- A comparison with other models previously used for similar tasks.

## How to Run

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on the implementation)
- Other libraries (if applicable)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transformer-analysis.git
